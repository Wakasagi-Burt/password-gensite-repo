# password-gensite-repo

The point of this site is generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters using uppercase, lowercase, number, and special characters. 
I worked with a friend who works in the web development field as a CTO for a logistics company to help me structure my JavaScript as well as countless youtube videos and articles on methods and logic as well as math and functions and properly structuring Javascript Code. 
This is the first time since starting the full stack bootcamp that I felt more confident with a coding language. 
I believe I am more confident with JavaScript than with HTML and CSS because everything is so explicitly defined and cut and dry and my belief is more of the challenge comes with learning and understanding the syntax.
